# Journey2Python3
I am learning python3, and this repo contains all the cool python3 scripts I am making along the way!

## What's the catch?
Each script will be partly broken; yeah you read that right, the main control flow will be perfect, but there will be a lot of room for improvements, bug fixes etc. etc.

## So why are you posting this here?
I procrastinated a lot before deciding that it's high time and now I should start learning python!

## How?

It's pretty simple!

1. I will upload the scripts in the "**ORIGINAL**" folder and will create 2 separate folders:
    
    a. TEST
    
    b. STABLE
 
2. I will start working on the TEST scripts to make them STABLE and anyone can join in and make their contributions
3. **DO NOT TOUCH THE ORIGINAL FOLDER!**
4. The goal is to make an ultra efficient script whose output is pretty as well! The scripts will have comments, lot's of 'em! I plan to explain the code in a way that even a beginner can understand each and every line of the code!

      a. If you are creating a pull request, please ensure your code contains comments!
5. This means that the **stable** scripts will feature the test scripts but only they are more powerful and pretty :)
6. This is a solo/co-op mission, so even if no one joins me, I will keep on making new test scripts and make them stable!
7. Feel free to submit new test scripts through the pull requests!
8. If you fork this repo, all I ask is that you should give credits to all the authors and contributors!


### P.S. THis readme too is imperfect, you might wanna start from here :)
